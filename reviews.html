              <p>"I had been to many yoga sessions in the past, but Poonam is one of the best instructors. Though I have attended her yoga sessions in zoom, her instructions were clear, very informative and helpful. 
              She would give you an alternative approach in case you are not able to perform the asanaand make sure the same level of strechingis attained.
              She involves everyone in yoga so that you dont realize the time. At the end of the session, the mind and body will be relaxed with zero stress. After attending her sessions, I got more interested in yoga and dont feel like missing any of her sessions."</p>

             <p>"After my first yoga session with Poonam, I was hooked.  I had never  before done any sort of yoga...but have had issues with back tightness and pain my whole adult life.  I have tried massages, physical therapy, and chiropractors.  Yoga is great it feels like I am healing from the inside.  Poonam is very attentive, even if she is teaching an advanced class she watches through the zoom screen to make sure all students are transitioning into and out of poses properly to ensure we do not strain anything.  She is always saying be careful with your neck :).  I am very thankful that my first yoga experience has been as student with Poonam." </p>
